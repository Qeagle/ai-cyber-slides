Create a visually premium, minimal-text, full-screen slide deck (React + TypeScript, Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion). 
Session: 25-minute masterclass for 150–170 college grads (mixed streams) at IMAGINE (Tamil Nadu govt program).
Topic: “Cyber Security in the AI World” with two tracks: (1) AI for Cybersecurity, (2) Cybersecurity for AI.
Goal: build curiosity + awareness + clear starter roadmap. End with a QR CTA (K7 Academy). 
Slides MUST be English-only. Presenter will narrate in Tamil if needed, but on-screen text stays English.

STYLE (very important):
- Minimal text: max 1 headline + 2–4 micro-bullets per slide (each bullet <= 4 words).
- Prefer: big typography, icons, cards, diagrams, counters, flows, “chips”.
- One idea per slide. Strong whitespace. Consistent layout and alignment.
- “Cyber” aesthetic: subtle grid, soft glow, clean modern. No clutter.
- No slide numbers. No dates. No logos. No company names. Keep examples generic and “safe wording”.
- Use high contrast for readability on projectors.

INTERACTION:
- Include hands-up questions on multiple slides (no polling links). 
- Presenter can ask quick questions; slides should support that (a dedicated “ASK” section in speaker notes).

OUTPUT FORMAT (required):
For each slide output:
1) Slide Title (English)
2) On-screen content (headline + micro-bullets)
3) Visual composition (exact: layout blocks, icons, diagram type)
4) Animation plan (sequence of reveals and transitions)
5) Speaker notes (what to say in 30–60 seconds; English notes, but written so it can be narrated in Tamil)
6) Audience prompt (1–3 questions)
7) Safety note (if needed: “generic example, no names”)

DECK STRUCTURE:
Total slides: 21 (skip any “room snapshot with counts” slide).
Time budget: ~21 minutes content + ~4 minutes Q&A.
